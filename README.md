A Slimefun addon that adds advanced machines for automation and crafting.

## Requirements
- Java 25
- Paper 1.16.* - 26.1.*
- [Slimefun 5](https://github.com/Slimefun5/Slimefun5)

## Building

```bash
./gradlew build
```

The compiled jar will be in `build/libs/`.

Custom item settings can be changed in `plugins/Slimefun/Items.yml`

## Machines
**Auto Crafting Table**: Automatically crafts vanilla recipes

**Auto Armor Forge**: Automatically crafts Armor Forge recipes

**Auto Magic Workbench**: Automatically crafts Magic Workbench recipes

**Auto Ancient Altar**: Automatically crafts Ancient Altar recipes

**Auto Table Saw**: Automatically crafts Table Saw recipes

**Water Sprinkler**: Electric sprinkler that grows crops in a 2 block radius

**Backpack Loader**: Moves items from inventory to backpack

**Backpack Unloader**: Empties backpack into inventory

**Advanced Auto Disenchanter & Ancient Book**: Allows players to disenchant specific enchants from items. Requires an Ancient Book to operate.

**Electric Dust Fabricator**: Turns cobblestone into sifted ore

**Electric Dust Recycler**: Turns eight of the same dust into one sifted ore

**Advanced Charging Bench & ACB Upgrade Card**: A charging bench which can be upgraded using upgrade cards.

## Generators
**Crank Generator**: Multiblock machine that generates power when clicked

## Items
**Watering Can**: Waters plants and trees to speed up their growth

**Helicopter Hat**: Allows you to float upwards when sneaking

**Fireproof Rune**: Drop this on your items to prevent them from burning

**Dolly**: Allows players to pick up chests and place them back down elsewhere, while retaining their inventories.

## Tools
**Upgraded Explosive Pickaxe & Upgraded Explosive Shovel**: 5x5 variants of the default explosive tools, and break 5 blocks in front of the player instead of 2 blocks all around. By default, these tools trigger other plugins that listen to block breaks, i.e. McMMO (Players get xp for every block broken). These features can be toggled in Items.yml.

**Upgraded Lumber Axe**: Breaks all logs within 2 blocks of each other, as opposed to adjacent blocks that the default lumber axe targets. Intended to be used for strange trees like acacia and jungle, and even custom trees.

**Scythe**: Breaks 5 crops per swing

**Wrench**: Quickly breaks Slimefun cargo and energy components.

**Paxel**: A pickaxe, axe, and shovel all in one.

## Misc
**Ender Chest Extraction Node**: Moves items from ender chest to a chest

**Ender Chest Insertion Node**: Moves items from a chest to an ender chest

*The extraction and insertion nodes do no stack items in inventories, that costs more performance and can be handled by cargo.

**Foundry & Superheated Furnace**: Allows the storage of dusts, and can be instantly converted to and from their ingot form.

**Barrels**: Storage containers that store one type of item each

**Warp Pad & Warp Pad Configurator**: Short distance teleportation pads

**Alternate Elevator Plate**: Functions the same as Slimefun's Elevator Plates, but it uses a Chest GUI. Can be used for cosmetic effect, of if your server does not support elevators when a player is muted, this will work.

**Portable Charger**: Multiple tiered handheld charders that allow players to charge items anywhere

## FAQ
**Can cargo be used on the Foundry?**
*Yes, but you can not place it directly on the Superheated Furnace. Place down a chest in its place, put the cargo on the chest, and then replace the chest wth the Superheated Furnace.*
